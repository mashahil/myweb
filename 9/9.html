<b>COMPUTER</B><br><BR>
<a font color="blue" href="#c4">GO TO TOP</font></a><br>
<p> A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carryout a set of arithemt and logical operations.since a sequence of operations can be redly changed,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
<p><b>cpu</b><br><br>
CPU is the abbreviation for central processing unit.The central processing unit (CPU) is the unit, which performs most of the processing inside a computer. To control instructions and data flow to and from other parts of the computer, the CPU relies heavily on a chip set, which is a group of microchips located on the motherboard.
cpu
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer. An ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.
PGOGRAMMING LANGUAGES
A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
c
C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.
c++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation
